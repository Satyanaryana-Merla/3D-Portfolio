## Deployment Recommendations

### For Vercel (Recommended)
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build for production
npm run build

# Deploy to Vercel
vercel --prod
```

### Environment Variables
Create a `.env.local` file:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_EMAILJS_SERVICE_ID=your_service_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_EMAILJS_TEMPLATE_ID=your_template_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_EMAILJS_PUBLIC_KEY=your_public_key
```

## Further Optimization Tips

### 1. **Optimize 3D Models**
- Use Draco compression for GLTF files
- Reduce polygon count in 3D models
- Consider using lower resolution textures

### 2. **Image Optimization**
- Convert all images to WebP format
- Use appropriate image sizes
- Implement responsive images

### 3. **Add Progressive Enhancement**
```javascript
// Example: Show simple animation while 3D loads
const [is3DReady, setIs3DReady] = useState(false);

return is3DReady ? <Canvas3D /> : <SimpleAnimation />;
```

### 4. **Implement Service Worker**
For offline functionality and faster subsequent loads:
```javascript
// In next.config.js
const withPWA = require('next-pwa')({
  dest: 'public',
  disable: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development',
});

module.exports = withPWA(nextConfig);
```

### 5. **Monitor Performance**
- Use Lighthouse CI in your deployment pipeline
- Set up Web Vitals monitoring
- Track Core Web Vitals metrics
